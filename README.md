# kaggle_sales-forecasting
This is my attempt on the Oct 2021 Datathon by MDSS

At first I tried using Python but I find it more comfortable using the lm function in R because I feel that I have more control over the variables. There was also functions such as SMAPE calculator and step-wise function to better the model.

Jupyter Notebook didn't work when I switched to R and I couldn't do any processing. I didn't manage to put my improved model but working on it was quite fun.

This helped me learn more about linear modelling. I hope I am confident enough in the future to do the Advance stream.
